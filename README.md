This is the repository from the 2nd Melbourne Symfony2 code jam, hosted on September 6th, 2011 at Flint Interactive.

11 developers attended the evening, and the goal of tonight was to get developers familiar with Doctrine2 ORM for model development.

The night was presented by Cameron Manderson and Sam Jarrett coded the demonstration on screen.
